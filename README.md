# 🧮 LaTeX Image Converter (Frontend)

This project provides the **frontend interface** for a LaTeX image converter web app.  
It allows users to **upload an image containing mathematical formulas**, preview it, and send it to the backend for LaTeX conversion.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Click **"Choose Image"** to select an image from your device.  
2. The image preview will appear on the screen.  
3. Click **"Convert"** to prepare the image for backend processing.  
4. An alert confirms that the image is ready to send to the backend.

> Once the backend is completed, this alert will be replaced with an actual API call.
